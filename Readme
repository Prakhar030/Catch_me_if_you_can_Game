About the game :-

There are two characters Joe and Ely.
Joe&#39;s task - Collect all the coins and ensure that Ely won&#39;t catch him.
Joe&#39;s control keys -
If pressed "w";, Joe should move up (only if there is no barrier above Joe).
If pressed "s";, Joe should move down (only if there is no barrier below Joe).
If pressed "d", Joe should move right (only if there is no barrier on the right side of Joe).
If pressed "a", Joe should move left (only if there is no barrier on the left side of Joe).
Ely's task - Catch Joe before he collects all the coins.
Joe's score - In the beginning, Joe's score is 0. The score starts incrementing as soon as he
starts collecting coins. The more he collects the coins, the more is his score.
When should the game end?
If Ely catches Joe, then the game just ends by displaying Joe&#39;s total score.
If Joe has collected all the coins, then the game just ends by displaying Joe&#39;s total score.
Necessary display during the gameplay -
● Scores must be displayed on the screen all the time.
● Movement of Joe and Ely on the map.
● Coins (i.e. dots) on the map must disappear from the map as Joe collects them.
● Ely can walk over the places where coins (i.e. dots) are placed and should not collect
them as his task is only to catch Joe.
● Ely should run by itself continuously towards Joe (should not be controlled by the
player).
